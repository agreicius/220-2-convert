          Equivalently,
          a first-order differential equation is an equation that can be written in the form
          <me>
            G(x, f'(x), f(x))=0
          </me>,

          A <em>solution</em> to a differential equation is any function <m>f(x)</m> that satisfies this equation.
          The <em>general solution</em> to a differential equation is a formula,
          possibly containing undetermined constants,
          describing all solutions to the differential equation.
