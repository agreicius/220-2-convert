      <title>Area estimates</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a nonnegative function defined on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
          and let <m>\mathcal{C}</m> be the graph of <m>f</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
          To estimate the area between
          <m>\mathcal{C}</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis proceed as follows:
          <ol marker="iitemsep0pttopsep0pt">
            <li>
              <p>
                Divide <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> equal subintervals,
                each of width <m>\Delta x=(b-a)/n</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For each subinterval pick a <em>sample</em>
                input <m>x^*</m> in that interval and build the rectangle whose base is the subinterval and whose height is given by <m>h=f(x^*)</m>.
                The area of this block is
                <me>
                  A=\underset{\text{ height } }{\underbrace{f(x^*)}}\,\underset{\text{ width } }{\underbrace{\Delta x}}
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Sum together the areas of the <m>n</m> blocks constructed in
                (ii).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how the sample inputs <m>x^*</m> are chosen in each subinterval,
          we get a different estimate.
          Below you find a number of common methods.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>x^*</m> is chosen as the left (resp. right) endpoint of each subinterval,
                the estimate is called a <em>left sum estimate</em>
                (resp.
                <em>right sum estimate</em>).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>x^*</m> is chosen as the midpoint of each subinterval,
                the estimate is called a <em>midpoint sum estimate</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>x^*</m> is chosen so that <m>f(x^*)</m> is the minimum value of <m>f</m> on each subinterval,
                the estimate is called a <em>lower sum estimate</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>x^*</m> is chosen so that <m>f(x^*)</m> is the maximum value of <m>f</m> on each subinterval,
                the estimate is called an <em>upper sum estimate</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

    <theorem>
      <title>Estimating net change from rate of change</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose physical quantity <m>Q</m> is a function of an input <m>x</m>,
          and that <m>f(x)</m> is the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
          of <m>Q</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
          The same method used to estimate area under the graph of a function now provides an estimate of the
          <em>net change of <m>Q</m></em>
          as <m>x</m> varies from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context we think of <m>r^*=f(x^*)</m> as a
          <em>fixed rate of change</em>
          over the given subinterval,
          in which case an individual term
          <me>
            f(x^*)\, \Delta x
          </me>
          in our sum is understood as an estimate of the net change of <m>Q</m> over the given subinterval under the simplifying assumption that <m>Q</m> changes with
          <em>fixed rate of change</em>
          <m>r^*=f(x^*)</m> over the interval.

          Below you find the graph of the velocity <m>v(t)</m>
          (in mph)
          of a driver heading due east <m>t</m> minutes after setting off.
          Compute an estimate of the area under the graph of <m>v(t)</m> between <m>t=0</m> and <m>t=20</m>,
          and explain what this estimate means physically speaking.
