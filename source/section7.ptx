      <title>Area of region between curves</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)\geq g(x)</m> for all <m>x\in [a,b]</m>.
          Let <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> be the graph of <m>f</m>,
          let <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> be the graph of <m>g</m>,
          and let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the region between <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> and
          <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> lying over the interval <m>[a,b]</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis.
          We define the area of <m>\mathcal{R}</m> to be the integral of <m>f-g</m> over <m>[a,b]</m>: i.e.,
          <me>
            \text{ area } (\mathcal{R})=\int_a^b f(x)-g(x)\, dx
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, suppose <m>x=p(y)</m> and <m>x=p(q)</m> are two functions of <m>y</m> satisfying
          <m>p(y)\geq q(y)</m> for all <m>y\in [c,d]</m>.
          Let <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> be the graph of <m>p</m>,
          let <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> be the graph of <m>q</m>,
          and let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the region between <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> and
          <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> lying over the interval <m>[c,d]</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis.
          We define the area of <m>\mathcal{R}</m> to be the integral of <m>p-q</m> over <m>[c,d]</m>: i.e.,
          <me>
            \text{ area } (\mathcal{R})=\int_c^d p(y)-q(y)\, dy
          </me>.

      <title>Graphical argument in support of area definition</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x)\geq g(x)</m> for all <m>x\in [a,b]</m>.
          Let <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> be the graph of <m>f</m>,
          let <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> be the graph of <m>g</m>,
          and <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the region between <m>\mathcal{C}_1</m> and
          <m>\mathcal{C}_2</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis.

            <li>
              <p>
                Suppose we also have <m>f(x)\geq g(x)\geq 0</m> for all <m>x\in [a,b]</m>.
                Then we have
                <md>
                  <mrow>\text{ area } (\mathcal{R})\amp =\int_a^b f(x)-g(x)\, dx</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp =\int_a^b f(x)\, dx -\int_a^bg(x)\, dx</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp =\text{ area } (\mathcal{R}_1)-\text{ area } (\mathcal{R}_2)</mrow>
                </md>,
                where <m>\mathcal{R}_i</m> is the region lying between
                <m>\mathcal{C}_i</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
                Intuitively,
                this difference of areas should indeed be the area between the two curves.

              <p>
                To reduce the general case <m>f(x)\geq g(x)</m> to the case above,
                simply shift both functions
                (and hence also <m>\mathcal{R}</m>)
                up by a large enough constant <m>C</m> so that <m>f(x)\geq g(x)\geq 0</m>.
                This operation does not affect the area of <m>\mathcal{R}</m>,
                and the <m>C</m> gets canceled in the integral computation thanks to the difference operator!

      <title>Regions between intertwined curves</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> and intersect one another finitely many times.
          Let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the region between the graphs of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> lying over the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
          To compute the area of <m>\mathcal{R}</m>, proceed as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Parition <m>[a,b]</m> into subintervals for which one of the functions is always greater than or equal to the other.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                On each such subinterval compute the area of the corresponding region by integrating the appropriate difference.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Sum up the areas you compute in (2).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

          Let <m>\mathcal{R}</m> be the region between the parabola <m>x+y^2=4</m> and the line <m>2x+y=2</m> lying in the first quadrant.
          Compute the are of <m>\mathcal{R}</m>.
          You may do this either by thinking of the curves as graphs of functions of <m>x</m>,
          or graphs of functions of <m>y</m>.
          Which approach is easier?

      <li>
        <p>
          Compute the area of the region between the parabolas
          <m>y=-x^2-2x</m> and <m>y=x^2-4</m> lying within the lines <m>x=-3</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
